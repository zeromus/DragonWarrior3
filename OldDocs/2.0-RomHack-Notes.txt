DW3 2.0 ideas and notes:


Change classes:

Hero 
	start with Ironize
	Will learn zap, Healusall, Lightening and other hero only spells at an appropriate level
	Will not learn the others, (level 99)
	Have him learn the rest on the fly when talking to a particular character (Sages)
	Greatly increased xp needed to go up levels, party should get to Romaly and he is still level 3!

Goof-off
	Rename to Jester
	Learn chance at Level 2
	Learn Invisibility at Level 18 (enough that you will likely have it before ditching him at the hall of registration)
	Learn Open at 34? (Something likely to be around the time of getting a final key
	Make XP for levels even lower (especially lower levels)
	Flashy Clothes have evasion effect of Cloak of evasion, find a better armor than that as their highest (water flying cloth?)
	Add MP growth

Wizards - 
	Will NOT learn Invisibility, Chance, Open

Merchants -
	Better HP gains, more weapon usage, no cap on HP at absurdly high levels (make him get up to 600 or so hp)
	Ideally: higher the level, the better he can haggle at the haggling shops!
	If possible, increase amount of gold they find

Fighters -
	More armor choices, for instance make Magic Bikini into Magic Suit or something
	Golden Claw doesn't increase attack rate, Call it "Steel Claw"

Soliders -
	Slightly better Agility
	Can equip ALL weapons no matter what (even wands and claws) except Sword of King's
	Can equip All Armor/Shields/Helmet's except for the Hero's equipment
Pilgram -
	Start with S

Rename Goof-off to Jester

Change character 1 to Male Jester

Have the soldier sitting at Luisa's place say something like:

His starting eqiupment: Jester's Staff (will have same effect as staff of transform), Wayfarer's Clothes (Flashy Clothes?)

Do Hero class changes (don't need to decide on levels for spells other than Ironize)

Do Goof-off changes (first 15 levels or so)

Change chance to use 2 mp

Slime - can call reinforcements (themselves), slight increase in stats

Your Grand Father will say:

new: "Ortega traveled the world and learned from sages"

Turn guy standing in door entrace to Sage, talk to him to learn expel

Block off overworld passage to Reeve.
Remove door in Castle that leads to cave (so you dont' need key to get in)

In locked door room in cave (that has the first seed of the game), Put a sage, and a boss fight

Add Spider's web and Poison moth powder to item shop in reeve

TODO: figure out a good boss fight that requires poison moth powder (two tough low Agility enemies that are not chaos resitant, and way too powerful)

Add Sledge Hammer to Alalian Weapon shop
Make Sledge Hammer able to be equipped by Merchants too

Magic Ball has golden claw effect

Boss fight to get into cave that needs Magic ball

Upon Entering Reeve, Fighter becomes available at Luisa's place
Have boy in upstairs in, say something like "My momma is a great fighter, she went to Aliahn to look for the hero"

Make Wing of Wyvern very expensive, 3000gp!
Make Medical herb 50gp

Remove Wing of Wyvern as a drop from all enemies on the continent
Remove Medical herb from most enemies on continent (replace with SOMETHING at least slightly useful)

Rename Cypress Stick to Twig make attack power 1


**********************************************************************
To Figure out
decide what weapon will be turned into Jester's Staff
Can we start default characters at a higher level than 1?
Start a class with more than 2 items?
Ability to hide default character at Luisa's place or add one on the fly
How to make an enemy set to Gang up on enemies, and equal chances of hitting any character
Add spells to Goof-off
Set "Golden Claw" effect on another item
"Fix" the parry fight glitch
How to set the effect of an item to be used in battle, and what classes can use item in battle
**********************************************************************

Misc plans:
Every non-hero-only spell will need to be learned from a Sage
One will be in noeniels (requiring that side quest to be completed)
One will be in romaly, but only talks to the king he can say "I only have audience with the King! Begone!"

Dhama has Registration hall, but can't register Merchant, Soldier, or Sage.
Remove book of Satoria from that tower

In assaram, have the wife of a merchant at the bar at night.  
During day she is next to shop, Have her say something like "My husband's brother has a shop in Alalian"
AT night she says "To be honest, his brother is the better merchant.  He gives twice the blade at half the price tee hee" (this reminds you to trek back to Aliahan to get that expensive weapon)

Multi-edge sword - not cursed but does hurt attacker, make attack power even higher, best sword for Solider but must consider that side effect
Unlucky Helmet - not cursed but still luck = 0, potentially best helmet for soldier but sonsider side effect

Remove invisibility herb as random drop and from item chops

At dhama hall, have someone say "Jesters are more useful than you think"

Jipang sage teaches firebane, and is hiding from Orochi (until orochi is beaten)

**********************************************************************
Alefgard
**********************************************************************

Add Registration Hall in Cantlin, can register Merchant, Solider, and Sage (with needing the book!)
WHen falling into Black Hole, you lose all your characters, show animation of Hero "being ironized", implying that's why he survived.
Now he is solo hero, make towns folk in Tantegel allude to a place in Hauskness to get a party
In Hauksness allude to Cantlin similarly
Boss fight to get into cantlin? (Stone hulk?)
A Solider at this new hall will say something like ("I would take a solider and two sages")

To Figure out, but not required for first Continent:
Allow Merchants to better haggle
Allow Merchants to find more gold
Make an item not cursed but keep the negative effects
Remove the "Golden Claw" effect from Golden claw
Increase cost of leaving invaluable item in Vault (from 1 to 100 or something)
Remaining bits for enemies
